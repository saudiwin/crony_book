# README

This Github repository contains code and data to reproduce results in the book [Making Democracy Safe for Business: Corporate Politics During the Arab Uprisings](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/making-democracy-safe-for-business/B937C65E6766D9A5D8AC390EA2182B21) by Robert Kubinec (Cambridge, 2023). The repository contains one R script for each empirical chapter in the book in the `rscripts` folder. These scripts were generated from the underlying Rmarkdown files used to create the book. However, because the text of the book cannot be released due to copyright issues, the code is included without the text. The `data` folder contains necessary survey and ancillary data for the code to run. All survey responses have been anonymized by removing identifiers and any variables that could indicate the location of respondents. 

All reproduced figures are saved by the code in the `figures` folder.

Note that the code reproduces some figures from image files rather than from raw data. These are usually descriptive graphics and if there is any question about these files, please email the author at (rmk7@nyu.edu). 

This data and code is released under the MIT license (see included file `LICENSE`).

The R scripts are as follows:

1. `04a-Case-Study-Egypt.R` : code for Chapter 2: The Egyptian Military as the Gatekeeper
2. `05a-Case-Study-Tunisia.R` : code for Chapter 3: Broad Rent-seeking and the Collapse of Tunisia's Anti-Democratic Coalition
3. `06-Quantitative-Surveys.R` : code for Chapter 4: Experiments in Business and Political Connections
4. `07-Quantitative-Surveys-Other.R` : code for Chapter 5: Crony Capitalism in International Comparison
